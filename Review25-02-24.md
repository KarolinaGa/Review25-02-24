## Madeira  
One of two autonomous regions of Portugal, the other being the Azores. It is an archipelago situated in the North Atlantic Ocean, in a region known as Macaronesia, just under 400 kilometres (250 mi) to the north of the Canary Islands and 520 kilometres (320 mi) west of the Kingdom of Morocco.[6][7] Madeira is geologically located on the African Tectonic Plate, although it is culturally, politically and ethnically associated with Europe, with its population predominantly descended from original Portuguese settlers.[8][9][10] Its population was 251,060 in 2021. The capital of Madeira is Funchal, which is located on the main island's south coast.

## Climate 
Madeira has many different bioclimates.[60] Based on differences in sun exposure, humidity, and annual mean temperature, there are clear variations between north- and south-facing regions, as well as between some islands. The islands are strongly influenced by the Gulf Stream and Canary Current, giving it mild to warm year-round temperatures; according to the Instituto de Meteorologia (IPMA), the average annual temperature at Funchal weather station is 19.6  C (67.3  F) for the 1981 2010 period. Relief is a determinant factor on precipitation levels, areas such as the Madeira Natural Park can get as much as 2,800 mm (110 in) of precipitation a year[61] hosting green lush laurel forests, while Porto Santo, being a much flatter island, has a semiarid climate (BSh). In most winters snowfall occurs in the mountains of Madeira.




## Funchal 
**The Capital**: a perfect combination between Nature, Culture and Lifestyle
Located on a large slope facing the Atlantic and shaped like a natural amphitheatre, Funchal is Madeira s largest tourist, commercial and cultural centre. Elevated to city status on 21 August 1508 by the royal charter of King Manuel I, the History of this archipelago's capital spans several centuries of traditions, culture and European cosmopolitanism. All without losing its connection with the exuberant Nature that surrounds it.

## Laurissilva Forest
The island of Madeira is the proud guardian of an environmental heritage of inestimable importance. The Laurissilva forest, which is about 20 million years old, dates back to the Miocene and Pliocene periods of the Tertiary Period. Nonetheless, the mark of time, which makes it a 'living fossil', does not seem to affect its vibrant energy.
